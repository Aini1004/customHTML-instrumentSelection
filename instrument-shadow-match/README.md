The Instrument Shadow Match Game is an interactive web-based game where players match musical instruments to their corresponding shadow images. The game is designed to be engaging and educational, helping players improve their recognition skills.

## Game Structure
The game consists of two main sections:

2. **Controls**: 
   - Click and drag an instrument from the top section.
